Documentation for Options Chain Data Retrieval
Overview
This document provides a description of the Python functions created to retrieve options chain data from the Alpha Vantage API. The primary function, get_option_chain_data, fetches data on options contracts, including key information such as bid/ask prices, implied volatility, and trading volume. This document also includes assumptions made, sample API responses, and how the data is processed to extract the required details.

--------------------------AI ASSISTANCE--------------------------
 AI assistance was utilized to streamline the explanation of the functions, refine code structure, and optimize error handling as follwing-
1. I got the basic concepts get cleared of options and requirements from Api for functions logics (From Microsoft Copilot, which extracted info from top websites)
2. Get the boiler plate codes of html requests and error handlings template form ChatGpt.
3. Major assistance that I got is of changing the query parameters and headers for testing different api's, I just passed structure of request - response objects and get the modified code from ChatGpt.
4. Also at time of API research, got the concepts of authorised api, access-referesh tokens, api_keys clearance from  ChatGpt. 


--------------------------CHALLENGES FACED--------------------------
1. While api research, many free api's also shows error 402 without any syntactical mistake, letter reading the documentation in detail, found it was premium one.
2. For the authorised api end points, many online brokers

Requirements
The Alpha Vantage API key is required for access to their data endpoints. Obtain this key from Alpha Vantageâ€™s official site and store it securely, as it is needed to authenticate requests to the API.



--------------------------LOGIC AND FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATION--------------------------
Functions
1. get_option_chain_data
Purpose: Retrieves options chain data for a specified underlying asset, such as a stock symbol, and processes the API response to provide key options data such as strike price, expiration date, and highest bid/ask prices.

Parameters:

symbol (str): The ticker symbol of the underlying asset (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple).
expiry (str): Expiration date of the options contract in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
option_type (str): Type of option ("call" or "put").
Returns:

A dictionary containing the highest bid and ask prices for each strike price available for the given options data.
Assumptions:

The function assumes that the Alpha Vantage API response contains valid options data for the specified parameters.
API rate limits are observed to avoid throttling.
Code Implementation:

Example API Response
The Alpha Vantage API returns data in JSON format. Below is a sample response for an options chain request:

json
Copy code
{
    "endpoint": "Historical Options",
    "message": "success",
    "data": [
        {
            "contractID": "AAPL231215C00100000",
            "symbol": "AAPL",
            "expiration": "2023-12-15",
            "strike": "100.00",
            "type": "call",
            "bid": "3.50",
            "ask": "3.60",
            "implied_volatility": "0.25",
            "delta": "0.45",
            "gamma": "0.05",
            "theta": "-0.02",
            "vega": "0.10",
            "volume": "200",
            "open_interest": "500"
        },
        {
            "contractID": "AAPL231215P00100000",
            "symbol": "AAPL",
            "expiration": "2023-12-15",
            "strike": "100.00",
            "type": "put",
            "bid": "1.10",
            "ask": "1.15",
            "implied_volatility": "0.30",
            "delta": "-0.45",
            "gamma": "0.04",
            "theta": "-0.03",
            "vega": "0.12",
            "volume": "100",
            "open_interest": "300"
        }
    ]
}

Processing the Response
The get_option_chain_data function filters the data to match the specific expiration date and option type (call or put). For each matching option, it extracts the strikePrice, bid, and ask values and adds them to the resulting list of options data. The output format is a list of dictionaries with relevant option details, making it easy to find the highest bid and ask prices for each strike price.

Example Output
For the above input, the function would produce output like this:

python
Copy code
[
    {"strikePrice": "100.00", "bid": "3.50", "ask": "3.60"},
    {"strikePrice": "100.00", "bid": "1.10", "ask": "1.15"}
]
Error Handling
The function includes basic error handling:

Missing Data: Checks if the data is present and includes a data key; otherwise, it returns an empty list.
Invalid Parameters: Assumes valid input for the symbol, expiry, and option_type parameters. Future implementations could validate these inputs to prevent API errors.
