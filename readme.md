Documentation for Options Chain Data Retrieval
Overview
This document describes the Python functions used to retrieve options chain data from the Alpha Vantage API. The primary function, get_option_chain_data, fetches data on options contracts and extracts essential information such as bid/ask prices, implied volatility, and trading volume. It includes assumptions, sample API responses, and details on data processing for extracting required information.

AI Assistance Summary
AI assistance was utilized to:

1. I got the basic concepts get cleared of options and requirements from Api for functions logics (From Microsoft Copilot, which extracted info from top websites)
2. Get the boiler plate codes of html requests and error handlings template form ChatGpt.
3. Major assistance that I got is of changing the query parameters and headers for testing different api's, I just passed structure of request - response objects and get the modified code from ChatGpt.
4. Also at time of API research, got the concepts of authorised api, access-referesh tokens, api_keys clearance from  ChatGpt. 

Or more formally -->
Clarify basic options concepts and API requirements for logic development.
Provide boilerplate code for HTTP requests and error handling.
Modify query parameters and headers for different API tests based on structured request-response templates.
Gain a foundational understanding of authorized API workflows, including access and refresh tokens.
Challenges Faced
API Access: Free APIs often returned a 402 error due to premium access requirements, despite correct syntax.
Authorized Endpoints: Researching authorization steps for APIs required understanding refresh tokens and broker-specific authentication, which was sometimes incomplete in online resources.
Requirements
To use this function, an Alpha Vantage API key is required. This key can be obtained from Alpha Vantageâ€™s official website and should be securely stored to authenticate requests.

Logic and Function Explanation
1. get_option_chain_data
Purpose: Retrieves options chain data for a specified underlying asset (e.g., a stock symbol), processes the API response, and returns key data like strike price, expiration date, and the highest bid/ask prices.

Parameters:

symbol (str): The ticker symbol of the underlying asset (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple).
expiry (str): Expiration date of the options contract, formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD".
option_type (str): Type of option ("call" or "put").
Returns:

A list of dictionaries with strikePrice, bid, and ask values, filtered by option type and expiration date.
Assumptions:

The API response contains valid options data for the specified parameters.
Rate limits are respected to avoid throttling.

Processing the Response
The get_option_chain_data function filters the data to match the specific expiration date and option type (call or put). For each matching option, it extracts the strikePrice, bid, and ask values and adds them to the resulting list of options data. The output format is a list of dictionaries with relevant option details, making it easy to find the highest bid and ask prices for each strike price.

Example Output
For the above input, the function would produce output like this:

Copy code
[
    {"strikePrice": "100.00", "bid": "3.50", "ask": "3.60"},
    {"strikePrice": "100.00", "bid": "1.10", "ask": "1.15"}
]
Error Handling
The function includes basic error handling:

Missing Data: Checks if the data is present and includes a data key; otherwise, it returns an empty list.
Invalid Parameters: Assumes valid input for the symbol, expiry, and option_type parameters. Future implementations could validate these inputs to prevent API errors.
